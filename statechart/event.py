class Event:
    """
    An event is a specification of a type of observable occurrence. The
    occurrence that generates an event instance is assumed to take place at an
    instant in time with no duration.

    Example:
        Create an instance of an event:
        my_event = Event(name='my event')

        Add the event trigger to a transition:
        Transition(start=a, end=b, event=my_event)

        Fire the event:
        await statechart.dispatch(event=my_event)

        If the current state has an outgoing transition associated
        with the event, it may be fired if the guard condition allows.

    Args:
        name (str): An identifier for the event.
        data Optional[dict]: Optional data dict.
