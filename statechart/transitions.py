    """
    A transition is a directed relationship between a source state and a target
    state. It may be part of a compound transition, which takes the state
    machine from one state configuration to another, representing the complete
    response of the state machine to a particular event instance.

    Args:
        start (State): The originating state (or pseudostate) of the
            transition.
        end (State): The target state (or pseudostate) that is reached when the
        transition is executed.
        event (Event|str): The event or event name that fires the transition.
        guard (function): A boolean predicate that  must be true for the
            transition to be fired. It is evaluated at the time the event is
            dispatched.
        action (function): An optional procedure to be performed when the
            transition fires.
